To qualify for the additional 500 bonus miles, you must have at least $500 in net purchases posted to your account within your first three months of Cardmembership.

				You can earn AIR&nbsp;MILES reward&nbsp;miles for eligible retail purchases at American Express merchants in Canada as follows: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						1 reward mile for every $10 at AIR&nbsp;MILES Sponsors. Visit the eligible sponsor list at americanexpress.ca/airmilessponsors. List is subject to change without notice.
					</li>
					<li>
						1 reward mile for every $10 at (i) stand-alone gasoline stations for automobiles, (ii) stand-alone grocery stores, and (iii) stand-alone drugstores. Purchases at merchants where gas, grocery and pharmacy sales are not their primary business (including superstores, wholesale clubs, alcohol retailers and general merchandise retailers) and purchases at sponsors do not qualify for the earn rate in this category.
					</li>
					<li>
						1 reward mile for every $15 of other card purchases.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Merchants are typically assigned codes and categorized based on what they sell. Earn rate of 1 reward&nbsp;mile for every $15 applies if the merchant code is not in an eligible category, the purchase is made using an electronic wallet or is not made directly from the provider of the good or service, e.g. through a third party or by using a mobile device (e.g. smart phone) with an attached card reader. Provided your account is in good standing, reward&nbsp;miles can be earned on eligible purchases less returns and other credits. Funds advances, interest, fees, balance transfers, Amex cheques and charges for travellers cheques and foreign currencies are not purchases and do not earn reward&nbsp;miles.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- 4 -->
				Account must be in good standing. AIR&nbsp;MILES reward&nbsp;miles will be earned on the amount of all purchases, less credits and returns. Funds advances, interest, balance transfers, Amex cheques, annual fees (if applicable), other fees and charges for travellers cheques and foreign currencies are not purchases and do not qualify for reward&nbsp;miles. Accelerated earn rate is available at Sponsors that are American Express merchants. Visit the Eligible Sponsor List at americanexpress.ca/airmilessponsors for details. List is subject to change without notice.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- 5 -->
				Purchase must be charged in full to an American Express<sup>&reg;</sup>* Card issued by Amex Bank of Canada. Subject to availability and to event and ticketing agent terms, conditions and fees. Not all seats are available. All sales are final. No refunds. No exchanges.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- 6 -->
				Use the American Express Card online or off, and you won't be held responsible for any fraudulent charges, as long as you've taken reasonable care to protect your account details and PIN. Notify us at once if your Card is lost or stolen, or you suspect it is being used without your permission.
			</li>
			<li> <!-- 7 -->
				Must be age of majority. Maximum 9 Supplementary Cards per account.  No annual fee for Supplementary Cards.

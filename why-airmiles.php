Not only will you earn on all your purchases wherever the Credit Card is accepted, you can earn more AIR&nbsp;MILES reward&nbsp;miles when you use both your AIR MILES Credit Card and your Collector Card at Sponsors. When it comes to the earning potential of an AIR MILES Credit Card, the sky&rsquo;s the limit.
